# Regression_Correlation_Python_Marketing

This project delivered a data-driven strategy to optimize marketing spend and maximize sales revenue for client's hospital system.

Using Multiple Linear Regression in Python, we analyzed the effectiveness of various marketing tactics across different client types (Large, Medium, and Small Facilities).

The primary outcome is a clear ROI table that provides concrete, segment-specific recommendations for future marketing budget allocation.

## What We Did

Followed a structured analytical approach to move from raw marketing data to actionable financial recommendations:

1.  **Data Analysis & Segmentation:** We explored the raw data to understand which clients (Large, Medium, Small) contributed the most revenue, identifying that **Medium Facilities** were disproportionately valuable.
2.  **Correlation & Causation:** We used Python statistical modeling libraries to determine which marketing tactics (Email, Flyer, Phone, Sales Contacts) had a direct, causal impact on sales.
3.  **Model Refinement:** We filtered the results to only include tactics with statistically significant returns (p-value < 0.05), ensuring our recommendations were highly reliable.
4.  **ROI Calculation:** The mathematical coefficient from the regression model was converted into a practical ROI figure, representing the predicted dollar return for every \$1 invested.

## Key Outcomes & Recommendations

The analysis proved that a single marketing strategy is inefficient and provided distinct optimal strategies for each client segment:

| Client Type | Highest ROI Tactic | Predicted Return (Per $1 Invested) | Strategic Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Large Facility** | **Sales Contact 1** | **~$11.90** | **Focus investment** on high-touch, direct sales visits. |
| **Medium Facility** | **Campaign Flyer** | **~$3.00** | Use **Flyers** as a cornerstone tactic; efficient and effective for this segment. |
| **Small Facility** | **Sales Contact 2** | **~$11.40** | **Immediately eliminate Phone campaigns** (found to have negative ROI) and re-allocate funds to direct sales efforts. |
